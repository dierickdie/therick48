A 4x12 ortho keyboard with USB C, SMD components, and 19mm spacing.

This is essentially a dumbed down Planck clone.

If you're looking for something with a numpad, look at the [therick48+16](https://github.com/therickthe/therick48.16) or [therick48+16SP](https://github.com/therickthe/therick48.16SP).

Although everything should<sup>(tm)</sup> work as is, it hasn't been physically tested, and I like playing with the traces to make it prettier/more efficient.

#### Why is it named therick48?
It started in fall of 2005 when I was just a boy. I started a new job, and needed a login name. The manager wrote The Rick (my first name is Rick). It has stuck ever since. Thanks, Sam! And 48 keys, but that was obvious. I hope.
